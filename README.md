# 42 Piscine C Projects

 ## ðŸ“Œ Description
   This project consists of C programs and functions that I developed during the 42 Piscine process. It covers fundamental C concepts, memory management, and algorithmic problem-solving. Additionally, it includes implementations of various standard functions, string manipulations, data structures, and low-level programming exercises that strengthen problem-solving skills and deepen understanding of the C language.

## ðŸ“¢ Notes
The code follows Norminette coding standards.
